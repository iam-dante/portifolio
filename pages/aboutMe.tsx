          Hi, {"I'm"} Brian Temu a software engineer with a passion for data
          science. I am a graduated student majoring in Data Science at
          University of Maryland Baltimore County and am now looking to break
          into the field of data engineering, analyst or scientist. I have
          experience working with big data, machine and deep learning projects
          and have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such
          as Python, R, JavaScript, and SQL.

          One of my recent projects involved developing was a deep learning
          competition of spoting the mask challenge that used deep learning. And
          another was an analysis on Open Baltimore Police Department Crime data
          to investigate the changes of total crimes incidents.
          {" I'm"} excited to see where my career in data science takes me and
          am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow my technical
          skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interests extend to the world of chess, where I continually enhance
          my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities. My diverse skill
          set empowers me to tackle a wide range of data-related challenges,
          create meaningful solutions, and explore the intriguing realm of deep
          learning. My unwavering support for Manchester City has been a
          lifelong support.
