In the summer of 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a bioinformatics internship at the [Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS)](https://www.igs.umaryland.edu/) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Over the course of 12 weeks, I immersed myself in the rapidly evolving field of bioinformatics and microbiome research, gaining both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

## A Day in the Life: Reading, Research, and Reflection

Every morning began with reading key scientific literature, which helped ground me in the foundational concepts of microbial genomics and vaginal microbiome studies. Some of the impactful papers I reviewed include:

- **[Lactobacillus iners: Friend or Foe?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37234911/)**
  This paper explored the dual nature of *L. iners* in the vaginal microbiome, highlighting its associations with both health and disease.

- **[Metagenomic Community State Types (mgCSTs)](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-023-01692-x)**  
  A fascinating study that introduced a new framework for categorizing vaginal microbiomes based on their functional gene content.

- **[Origins of Vaginal Acidity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11527880/)**  
  This article offered insight into how lactic acid production by certain bacteria helps maintain the acidic environment crucial for vaginal health.

- **[Standardized Gram Stain Interpretation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1706728/)**  
  A cornerstone in understanding bacterial vaginosis diagnostics through standardized microscopic methods.

Engaging with this literature gave me a solid background to support the hands-on work I was doing.

## Practical Training: Learning the Tools of the Trade

The most exciting part of the internship was learning how to work with real genomic data using the advanced computational infrastructure at IGS. I had access to their high-performance computing grid, which included:

- Over 90 high-throughput computing nodes
- Large memory servers for complex data processing
- Tools such as **CloVR**, **Ergatis**, and the **Data Intensive Academic Grid (DIAG)**

With guidance from my mentors, I learned to use these systems to:

- Perform genome assembly and annotation
- Run multiple genome alignments
- Analyze microbial community structures

This hands-on experience gave me a deeper appreciation of how computational tools can solve biological problems.

##  Discovering Bioinformatics

Before this internship, bioinformatics was a word I had only heard in passing. Over the summer, it transformed into a field I now genuinely enjoy. I learned how essential it is in processing, analyzing, and interpreting biological data—especially in areas like microbiome research where datasets are massive and complex.

## Collaboration and Mentorship

Another highlight of my time at IGS was the collaborative atmosphere. I was surrounded by passionate researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds. I attended seminars, participated in team discussions, and had one-on-one mentorship sessions that helped me understand not just the *how*, but the *why* behind our work.

The guidance and feedback from my supervisor and the IGS team played a crucial role in my learning process. Their openness to questions and willingness to teach made this an incredibly supportive environment for a newcomer like me.

## Final Thoughts

This internship was truly a turning point in my academic journey. I’m incredibly grateful to my supervisor and the entire Institute for Genome Sciences for giving me this opportunity. It has solidified my interest in bioinformatics and inspired me to continue exploring the intersection of biology and data science.

I’m walking away from this experience with new skills, lasting connections, and a strong desire to contribute to the field of genomics. IGS has left a lasting impact on my career trajectory—and for that, I’m sincerely thankful.



## Summary

During Summer 2024, I completed a bioinformatics internship at the Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland, Baltimore. Through daily literature reviews, hands-on computing projects, and mentorship, I gained a deep understanding of microbiome research and computational biology. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also inspired me to pursue a future in bioinformatics.
