## A Day in the Life: Reading, Research, and Reflection
It was a summer filled with learning and discoverying new things everyday, it was fun also challenging to say at least, as I was new to the field of bioinfomatics and computational biology. Each day started differently some had meetings with the supervisor while other days were dedicated to reading and research, when I say reading it was the amount of papers that I needed to understand (i like it).

Some of the impactful papers I reviewed include:

- **[Lactobacillus iners: Friend or Foe?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37234911/)**
  This paper explored the dual nature of *L. iners* in the vaginal microbiome, highlighting its associations with both health and disease.

- **[Metagenomic Community State Types (mgCSTs)](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-023-01692-x)**  
  A fascinating study that introduced a new framework for categorizing vaginal microbiomes based on their functional gene content.

- **[Origins of Vaginal Acidity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11527880/)**  
  This article offered insight into how lactic acid production by certain bacteria helps maintain the acidic environment crucial for vaginal health.

- **[Standardized Gram Stain Interpretation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1706728/)**  
  A cornerstone in understanding bacterial vaginosis diagnostics through standardized microscopic methods.

Reading these papers made me realize the depth and complexity of this reasearch area but also gave me the cofidence to discuss with the team, contribute to ongoing projects, and even propose new ideas based on the latest findings.

## Practical Training: Learning the Tools of the Trade

The most exciting part of the internship was learning how to work with real genomic data using the advanced computational infrastructure at IGS. I had access to their high-performance computing grid, which included:

- Over 90 high-throughput computing nodes
- Large memory servers for complex data processing
- A robust storage system for managing vast datasets

We had workshops and training sessions that covered essential tools and techniques, including:
- Command-line interfaces for data manipulation
- Scripting in Python and R for data analysis
- Understanding and using bioinformatics software and pipelines

This hands-on experience gave me a deeper appreciation of how computational tools can solve biological problems.

##  Discovering Bioinformatics

Before this internship, bioinformatics was a word I had only heard in passing. Over the summer, it transformed into a field I now genuinely enjoy. I learned how essential it is in processing, analyzing, and interpreting biological data—especially in areas like microbiome research where datasets are massive and complex. This experience was amazing, as I got to see how computational methods can uncover patterns and insights that would be impossible to find through traditional laboratory techniques.

## Collaboration and Mentorship

Another highlight of my time at IGS was the collaborative atmosphere. First things first I want to thank my supervior [Dr. Johanna B. Holm, PhD](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/holm-johanna/) for being an incredible mentor she guided me through the intricacies of bioinformatics, always encouraging me to ask questions and think critically about the promblem that we are solving. 
Her expertise and patience were invaluable as I navigated this new field.I was surrounded by passionate researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds. I attended seminars, participated in team discussions, and had one-on-one mentorship sessions that helped me understand not just the *how*, but the *why* behind our work.

## Final Thoughts

This internship was truly a turning point in my academic journey and to get experience in this country. I’m incredibly grateful to my supervisor and the entire Institute for Genome Sciences for giving me this opportunity. It has solidified my interest in bioinformatics and inspired me to continue exploring the intersection of biology and data science.

I’m walking away from this experience with new skills, lasting connections, and a strong desire to contribute to the field of genomics. IGS has left a lasting impact on my career trajectory—and for that, I’m sincerely thankful.

## Summary

During Summer 2024, I completed a bioinformatics internship at the Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland, Baltimore. Through daily literature reviews, hands-on computing projects, and mentorship, I gained a deep understanding of microbiome research and computational biology. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also inspired me to pursue a future in bioinformatics.
